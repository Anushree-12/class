# Activity-3

In this activity, we'll walk through **all** of the steps of building an interactive visualization in React. Follow the steps below to build an interactive bar chart of Olympic Medalists.

## Instructions
1. Transform the scaffolding of this application by running `create-react-app .` _in this folder_. Note the `.` after `create-react-app`, which will create the app in the _current folder_. 

2. Move the `data/` folder into the recently created `public/` folder. This is where you'll need to store publicly accessable content (`.csv` files, images, etc.).
